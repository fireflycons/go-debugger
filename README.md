## Variables

<a name="Attached"></a>Attached is true if this process was launched by a debugger.

This variable is initialized by an init\(\) function, therefore there is zero cost to use it. Example use case would be to dynamically set a context timeout such that it does not cancel in the middle of a debugging session.

Note that the value will not be true if you attach a debugger to an already running process.

```go
var Attached bool
```
